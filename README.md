Predicting Breast Cancer in a Patient

Abstract
        Breast cancer is a prevalent and life-threatening disease, responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide. It is the most common cancer among women and necessitates early detection and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. This project focuses on utilizing ensemble techniques and data mining methods to predict breast cancer in patients based on cell nuclei characteristics.

Problem Statement
        The main objective of this project is to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not by analyzing the details of cell nuclei extracted from breast mass. The prediction is made using ensemble techniques, which combine the power of multiple algorithms to improve accuracy. Before building the predictive model, an essential step involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data's characteristics. Additionally, the model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics beyond just accuracy.

Dataset Information
        The dataset used for this project contains several predictor variables and one target variable, 'Diagnosis.' The target variable has two categories: 'Benign,' indicating the absence of cancer, and 'Malignant,' indicating the presence of cancer with harmful effects on the cells.

Variable Description
radius: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
perimeter: Observed perimeter of the lump.
area: Observed area of the lump.
smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths.
compactness: (perimeter^2) / area - 1.0.
concavity: Severity of concave portions of the contour.
concave points: Number of concave portions of the contour.
symmetry: Lump symmetry.
fractal dimension: "Coastline approximation" - 1.
Diagnosis: Whether the patient has cancer or not ('Malignant' or 'Benign').
The dataset provides multiple features for each image, resulting in a total of 30 features. These features include mean, standard error, and "worst" (mean of the three largest values) values for each of the characteristics mentioned above.

Scope
This project encompasses the following key steps:

Data Analysis: Analyzing the available data to understand relationships among variables and identify patterns.

Data Pre-processing: Preparing the data for modeling by handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

Model Building: Training an ensemble classifier, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on the provided features.

Performance Evaluation: Assessing the classifier's correctness in classifying data, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC ROC) curve.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the SVM classifier using cross-validation to optimize model performance.

Learning Outcome
Participants in this project will gain valuable skills and knowledge, including:

Understanding the relationships among variables in real-world datasets.
Building a machine learning model using ensemble techniques.
Evaluating model performance using various metrics.
Tuning hyperparameters to enhance model accuracy.
Gaining insights into the field of medical diagnosis and the importance of accurate predictions in healthcare.
This project not only provides an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques but also contributes to improving breast cancer diagnosis, potentially saving lives through early detection.





E-commerce Customer Segmentation

Abstract:
A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the
market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the

companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-
commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like

previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.

Problem Statement:
Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster
customers with similar interest.

Dataset Information:
The data was collected from a well known e-commerce website over a
period of time based on the customer’s search profile.

Variable Description:
Column Description
Cust_ID Unique numbering for customers
Gender Gender of the customer
Orders Number of orders placed by each customer in the past

Remaining 35 features (brands) contains the number of times
customers have searched them

Scope:

Problem Statement – K means
● Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights
about the purchase pattern
● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
● Segmenting customer based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’)
with the help of silhouette score

Learning Outcome:
The students will get a better understanding of how the variables are
linked to each other and will be able to apply cluster analysis to business
problem such as customer segmentation.
